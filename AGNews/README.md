# AG News Experiments
The experiment notebooks can be found in `relMaps` folder <br> <br>
`main_trainer.py` and `tester.py` are used to train and test the model respectively. <br>
Saved weights and dataloader file `CustomDataset.py` are present in `fasttext` folder. <br> <br>
Originally, the notebooks in `relMaps` folder were present in the current directory, and hence, it needs to be moved back for importing the necessary files.
